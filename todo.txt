 - make the extension replaces the select pages with custom ones. ✅
  - make the page replaces better (no need to fully replace the page or whatever)
 - get an api key or something to get the user's stats, such as following, recommends, etc. and also use for streamer stats. ✅
 - get channel list working
 - make scripts & css for embedded video & chat.
 - version checking
