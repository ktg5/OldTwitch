here's how we're gonna do this:
 - remake the whole 2018 & 2015 twitch site
  - 2018: https://web.archive.org/web/20180223002421mp_/https://www.twitch.tv/, https://web.archive.org/web/20180223010527/https://www.twitch.tv/xqcow & https://youtu.be/DdQM-YauwJk?t=90s
  - 2014/15: https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/twitch-in-2014
 - make the extension replaces the select pages with custom ones.
 - get an api key or something to get the user's stats, such as following, recommends, etc. and also use for streamer stats.
 - figure out the "usher.ttvnw.net" (https://github.com/pixeltris/TwitchAdSolutions/issues/7) with a combo of twitch's internal api to get streams & shit.
